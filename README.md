### HW01 Class and Inheritance
* Consider three different types of bears, Polar bear, Grizzly and Black bear. 
* Polar bear is known to be the most aggressive, and then Grizzly and then Black bear.

### HW02 C++ Programming Practice
* 2-1. WordCounter 
- Implement a WordCounter class which counts the number of word and characters from a text. The
class should provide interfaces to count word (GetWordCount), character (GetCharacterCount) and
the number of unique words (GetUniqueWordCount). In addition, it can count a particular word
(GetWordCount OneWord).

* 2-2. Prime Number
- print all prime numbers between two integer numbers given by users

### HW03 Read file, calculate correlation and run simple linear regression
* Implement two classes: DataFrame and Matrix. DataFrame reads a csv file and can generate a Matrix object using specific columns. Matrix class stores a vector (n*1 matrix) or a matrix data and provide interface of matrix operations.

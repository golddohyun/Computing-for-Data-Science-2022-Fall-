### HW02 C++ Programming Practice
> 2-1. WordCounter
- Implement a WordCounter class which counts the number of word and characters from a text. The class should provide interfaces to count word (GetWordCount), character (GetCharacterCount) and the number of unique words (GetUniqueWordCount). In addition, it can count a particular word(GetWordCount OneWord).

> 2-2. Prime Number
- Write a C++ code to print all prime numbers between two integer numbers given by users.
- Include two input numbers to check prime number.
